    				<p><strong>The chairs workshop</strong> is a two-session series—one session in the fall and the other in the spring. Each session has a different set of topics. The workshop is designed to be interactive and participative, rather than a lecture/listen format. Each topic to be discussed has an assigned reading period followed by small group discussion.</p>
    				<p>The purpose of these workshops is to support the development of the chair as an academic leader within the department and within the institution as a whole.  The workshop is designed to stimulate discussion and enable interaction among chairs and provide an opportunity to discuss rules and procedures, legal issues, common frustrations, and many other topics of general interest.</p>
